# Background
This is a bare-bones educational GIS visualization built from the MySQL dump of [Iron March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_March), a neo-nazi forum shut down in November 2017. Mapped are users, their locations based on IP, and their emails.

# Plans
Incorporate direct message data drawn between users.
